### Journaling

InnerWell provides a secure space for users to document their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Whether it's a daily reflection or a moment of inspiration, the journaling feature encourages self-expression and introspection.

### Mood Tracking Tests

Users can assess their mental well-being with scientifically validated tests such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale for anxiety. These tests provide valuable insights and help users track their emotional health over time.

### Medicine Details Lookup

InnerWell integrates with the OpenFDA medicine API to provide comprehensive details about medications. Users can simply enter the name of a medication, and InnerWell fetches essential information such as usage instructions, side effects, and precautions, empowering informed decision-making about medication management.
